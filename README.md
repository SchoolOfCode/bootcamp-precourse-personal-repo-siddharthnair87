# I have made a tribute page for ***Toni Morrison***. 

I wanted to make a tribute page about a person I didn't know too much about as this would give me the opportunity to educate myself about someone new and the whole process has been a really good experience for me. 

This is just the first draft and I would like to make the website a bit more interesting using a bit more javascript, but there are a few more tutorials  I need to watch before I attempt anything else. 

So, this is a brief outline of what I learned from the whole process:

The first thing I learnt about debugging is closing tags. I feel like I quite easily overlooked the closing tags more than once and that caused the page to misbehave. It took me a while to realize where the problem was. So, I will be keeping an eye out for closing tags. 

I used css grid to position the different elements. I found it to be the best way to move things around quickly. I also have a much better understanding of how to use margins and padding. I also did a bit of animation but nothing worth bragging about. Still, I think it was good to start familiarising myself with some of the basic concepts. I do intend to polish it a bit more before I move on to the next project. 

All in all, it was a pretty simple project but it was a lot of fun doing it and time flew by.
